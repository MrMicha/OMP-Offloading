# Introduction

`saxpy` performs the `saxpy` operation on host as well as accelerator.
The performance (in MB/s) for different implementations is also compared.

The `saxpy` operation is defined as:

$$ y := a * x + y $$

where:

* `a` is a scalar.
* `x` and `y` are single-precision vectors each with n elements.
* For testing n is assumed to be $2^{22}$.
* The following table only summarizes the most important points. For more
  details on the ial-th implementation see comments in `hsaxpy.c` (on host)
  and `asaxpy.c` (on accelerator).
