# Introduction

`matMul` performs matrix multiplication in single-precision on GPU. The
performance (in GFLOPS) for different implementations is compared and the
numerical results are also verified.

* Column-major is assumed thru the entire code!

* For testing the dimension of all matrices are assumed to be 4096 x 4096.

* The following table only summarizes the most important points. For more
  details on the ial-th OpenMP GPU implementation see comments in `matMulAB.c`.

# Build

```bash
autoreconf -i; ./configure; make; make check
```

`make check` has been tested on OCuLUS (with OpenCCS) and P53s (without OpenCCS).
